# AI-sound-detection
Deepfake voice detection using CNN-LSTM neural network and mel spectograms

Uses The Fake-or-Real (FoR) Dataset (deepfake audio) from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedabdeldayem/the-fake-or-real-dataset/ (for-2sec)

This repository contains two models
Neural Network folder: Uses a train-test-val split (80%, 10%, 10%) <br />
Cross Valid folder: Uses Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation (5 folds), trained on full data
